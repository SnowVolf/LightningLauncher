# LightningLauncher

This repository contains the source code of the 'Lightning launcher' Android app, whose original 
author is Pierre, with contributions from TrianguloY and F43nd1r.

LLX source code is published as is. Since it is now open source, some parts of the code are 
deprecated. This includes Google hooks and decomposition in eXtreme/trial flavours.

Also the wear and wear_manager projects are fully out of date.
